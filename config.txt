### ABOUT ###
Everything above this line is config settings. Line 1 is the location of the names of the labs, stored as .txt file. This can be stored on a web server or on the local disk.
Line 2 is the locations of the test inputs and expected outputs, as a directory. They should all be .txt files located within the same directory. An example would be like this:
  prob001IN.txt
  prob001OUT.txt
  prob002IN.txt
  prob002OUT.txt
Line 3 should be the IP of the teachers instance. It can be left blank if no teacher instance is used.
