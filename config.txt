Everything above this line is config settings. Line 1 is the location of the names of the labs, stored as .txt file. This can be stored on a web server or on the local disk.
Line 2 is the locations of the test inputs and expected outputs, as a directory. They should all be .txt files located within the same directory. An example would be like this:
  prob001IN.txt
  prob001OUT.txt
  prob002IN.txt
  prob002OUT.txt
Line 3 should be the IP of the teachers instance. It can be left blank if no teacher instance is used.
Line 4 is important only if you're using Windows. It will be your JAVA_HOME location. I ran into a lot of problems trying to make it find that out automatically so I ditched it and now you have to input it manually.
